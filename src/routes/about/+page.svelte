    <p>
      This website exists because, I wanted something to "store" the books I
      have read, (and potentially also the books I want to read). Why not use
      some of those popular apps? Idk, but this also gave me a reason too look
      into
      <a href="https://svelte.dev/" class="underline">Svelte</a>
      , and built a simple app with it. And.. there we go :)
